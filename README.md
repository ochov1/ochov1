Full-stack engineer with 20+ years of experience building data-intensive business systems and AI-ready architectures.
I design platforms where structured data, APIs, and AI models meet real production constraints.

My background spans FileMaker at enterprise scale, modern Node.js / React / Python, and AI systems that work with imperfect, legacy, and regulated data. I focus on AI readiness, data quality, deterministic AI pipelines, and hybrid local + cloud LLM architectures.

Recent work includes:

AI-ready insurance platforms with large versioned APIs and strict regulatory constraints

An AI Readiness & Data Quality Assessment Engine for enterprises

Hybrid on-device + cloud AI mobile systems (privacy-first, offline-capable)

Document intelligence, OCR, semantic search, and vector databases

Bridging legacy systems with modern AI without rewriting everything

I care about:

AI that is explainable, auditable, and production-safe

Contract-driven APIs and deterministic AI inputs/outputs

Data quality as a prerequisite for machine learning

Practical systems, not demos

Tech I use daily: Node.js, Python, PostgreSQL, Docker, FileMaker, React, local LLMs, vector DBs, OCR, REST APIs.

I build things meant to survive reality, not just benchmarks.
